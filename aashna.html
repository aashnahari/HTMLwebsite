    <b>Overview:</b>
</div>
    <p>The Shih Tzu (UK: /ˌʃiːˈtsuː/, US: /ˈʃiːtsuː/; Chinese: 西施犬; pinyin: Xī Shī quǎn literally "Hsi Shih dog") is a toy dog breed originating from Tibet and having been bred from the Pekingese and the Lhasa Apso.

    Shih Tzus are well known for their short snout and large round eyes, as well as their ever growing coat, floppy ears, and short and stout posture. Although small in size, they are well known for their largely fun and playful personality, and calm and friendly temperament.
    
    They are able to adapt well in different situations. Due to their highly independent nature, they are not considered the most obedient breed.</body></p>
