<li><center>I will be answering 3 questions about Yorkies.</center></li>

<p><center>1)What makes Yorkies a good dog?</center></p>

<p><center><font color = "purple">Yorkies are the perfect dog for all. They are tiny so they are perfect for apartments, but they are not shy, so they are also perfect for bigger homes. In addition, they love to cuddle, and have huge personalities regardless of thier size.
</center><p>
<p><center><font color = "black"> 2) What are some basics about Yorkies?</center></p>
<p><center><font color = "purple">Yorkies can range from 6-10 pounds. They only reach to about 6-7 inches, so they are pretty small. In addition, they are hypoallergenic which means that they have human hair so people with dog allergies wont have reactions to yorkies. </center></p>
<p><center><font color = "black"> 3) Are Yorkies cute?</center></p>
<p><center><font color = "purple">I mean you tell me...</center></p>
