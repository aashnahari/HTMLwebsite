<h4>I have three reasons why I find dogs scary</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Their speed</li>
    <li>Their guarding ability</li>
    <li>Their bark</li>
</ol>

<center><img src="running.png" alt="One dog chasing another dog"></center>

<p><center>The first is that they can run faster than me, so if I'm being chased by one, chances are I'll be overtaken by it</center></p>

<center><img src="guarding.png" alt="One dog acting as a guard dog"></center>

<p><center>The second is that they're often used as guard dogs, so they've been trained to attack people and thus are dangerous</center></p>

<center><img src="barking.png" alt="One dog acting as a guard dog"></center>

<p><center>Finally, the last reason is that they bark really loudly and aggressively</center></p>
